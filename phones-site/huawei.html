        <h3>HUAWEI P50 Pocket</h3>
    </strong>
    <p>Easier on your pocket in more ways than one, the <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/bg/phones/p50-pocket/specs/" target="_blank">Huawei</a> P50 Pocket is the company's latest foldable, and this one is available globally for a change. In contrast to last year's Mate X2, the Pocket will be sold outside of China, and its EUR1300 starting price can almost pass for reasonable, plus it's the other type of form factor that you might also call compact.</p>

    <p>The P50 Pocket is the half-phone-to-full-phone kind of foldable, similar to the Galaxy Z Flip lineup, leaving the tablet-sized Mate X2 for those with deeper pockets (and access to the Chinese market). Smaller than a pack of cigarettes when folded, the Pocket opens up to reveal a generously-sized 6.9-inch OLED display on the inside, so it's that little bit bigger than the Flip. It's also a touch heavier, but has a larger battery to show for it.</p>
        <p>As part of the high-end P50 family, the Pocket is treated to a Snapdragon 888 chipset, only minus the 5G capability because of the USA-China feud that's been dragging Huawei's smartphone business down for more than 3 years now. With a base config of 256GB and 8GB of RAM (512GB/12GB available, too), the Pocket is looking strong on the basics. Oh, it has a slot for external memory, NanoMemory as it may be, so it's one-upping the Flip once again.</p>
